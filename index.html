      <h1>The day I saw you</h1>
      <p>
        I was a regular, boring guy who had nothing else on his mind except
        doing his work. I came to work as usual that day, a busy warehouse
        during Christmas time. Nothing was different, and I had no excitement or
        wish for something to change. I was definitely not looking for love.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then, in between all that craziness and chaos and noise, I saw you. You
        took my breath away. There was something that made me feel different
        that day, something that told me, “Enough of being like this.” It felt
        like my life was going to change from that day.
      </p>

      <h1>A moment I couldn’t ignore</h1>

      <p>
        I could not forget that smile I saw. Even after going home, it stayed
        right there in front of my eyes. I could see you clear as day. No matter
        what I did, you were there. Anyway, I tried to brush it off, tried to be
        normal again, to stay away from all the rush I was feeling. I told
        myself it was just another day.
      </p>

      <p>
        But that evening, when I came back to work, I realised this feeling
        wasn’t going to go away. I saw you again, and in that moment, I knew I
        had to speak to you. I didn’t know how, and I didn’t have a plan but I
        knew I should.
      </p>

    <div class="card third-card">
      <h1>When we finally spoke</h1>

      <p>
        After so many attempts to speak to you, to build a conversation, all I
        had was your name. My heart desperately craved even a few words from
        you. I changed departments, manipulated situations, people, everything.
        I struggled more than I ever should have, just to have one conversation
        with you.
      </p>

      <p>
        And then the day finally came. Yes, we spoke. You didn’t share much, but
        at least we had a conversation. I know that for you, I was probably just
        another guy in a warehouse. But that day, I had a smile on my face. I
        ignored the fact that you told me you had a boyfriend.
      </p>

      <p>You made me happy after a long time.</p>

    <div class="card fourth-card">
      <h1>When work felt different</h1>

      <p>
        Our conversation brought me a little closer to you. Day by day, I tried
        everything so I could end up working with you. My shifts started to feel
        easier and shorter. Every time your boyfriend came up, it felt like a
        nail through my heart.
      </p>

      <p>
        Anyway, day by day, you felt more and more interesting, like a missing
        puzzle piece. A piece I didn’t even know was missing, but without it, I
        couldn’t be happy.
      </p>

      <p>
        Suddenly, all my days began to feel special. Work became interesting. I
        wanted to come to work all the time. And a day without talking to you
        made the entire day feel bad.

      <h1>When it started to feel real</h1>

      <p>
        We started meeting outside. You invited me to your home. You started to
        trust me. It felt good that, to you, I became someone more than just
        another guy. I wish you could see how I was feeling. I wish you could
        feel it too.
      </p>

      <p>
        The excitement of meeting you, the eagerness to work with you, the way I
        felt disappointed when we didn’t have work. The happiness I felt when we
        went out. Oh my God, it was like a movie scene—and you were the only
        main character in my movie.
      </p>

      <p>Then came the day when you had to go away for a month.</p>

      <h1>When being alone felt different</h1>

      <p>
        Living alone was never a problem. Here in Manchester, I had spent almost
        four years by myself. I went to the cinema alone, ate alone at
        restaurants, went bowling alone, stayed alone at home and I was always
        okay with it. No complaints. No issues.
      </p>

      <p>
        But when I learned that you were going away, something felt uneasy. Even
        though it was only for a short time, it felt like a mild pain. Like I
        wouldn’t be able to work. Like I would have to push myself through those
        days. I wanted to go somewhere, anywhere, so I went to Europe as soon as
        you left.
      </p>

      <p>
        And honestly, everywhere I went, I saw you. Everything I experienced, I
        wished I was experiencing with you. That’s when I realised it wasn’t
        just a crush. It was something much bigger.
      </p>

      <p>It was love.</p>

      <p>And the moment I realised that, I couldn’t hold it in anymore.</p>

    <div class="card seventh-card">
      <h1>When I finally said it</h1>

      <p>
        I came back and waited for you to return. I tried so hard to hold
        everything in. Then you landed in Manchester, and something inside me
        started pushing harder. I wasn’t okay anymore. I had to tell you how I
        felt about you.
      </p>

      <p>
        I couldn’t hold it in until we met at work. It felt impossible to keep
        it inside any longer. Even if you were going to walk away, I had to tell
        you. And I did. I told you everything, everything I felt.

    <div class="card eighth-card">
      <h1>Kiss or die</h1>

      <p>
        To my surprise, you understood me. You tried to treat me normally. We
        went back to being friends again, the same work, the same excitement,
        the same you. But now, I could say my feelings out loud. I felt myself
        getting closer to you, day by day, little by little.
      </p>

      <p>
        Every moment with you became a picture I still remember. I wanted to
        spend as much time with you as possible. I grabbed every chance I got.
        And then that day came. It felt like any other night out, just you and
        me, exploring Manchester. The same you, making my heart skip a beat with
        your smile.
      </p>

      <p>
        And again, that feeling kicked in. The feeling to kiss you. I had wanted
        to kiss you from day one, but that day it felt like kiss or die. There
        was so much at stake. But I knew my heart would stop if I didn’t do it.
        So I did it anyway.
      </p>

      <p>
        Those three seconds, I will never forget them for the rest of my life.
        It was pure magic. It felt like something I had been waiting for for so
        long. It felt soft. It felt unreal. Hundreds of feelings rushed through
        me in those three magical seconds.
      </p>

      <p>
        You hated me for that.<br />
        But it was worth it.

      <p>
        I knew you were falling in love with me, but I wanted to be sure. And
        when you kissed me back, I was sure. I could have stopped kissing you,
        but I never wanted it to stop. I kept kissing you again and again and
        again.
      </p>

      <p>
        From that day on, I never wanted this to end. Everything started to feel
        meaningful. I felt happy just seeing you laugh. I wanted you to
        experience everything. I know it’s not always possible, but I wanted to
        make sure I did everything I could just to see you laugh, that laugh
        where you forget everything else in your life.
      </p>

      <p>
        The days we spent together, the fights, our cooking sessions, our dreams
        together, the risks we took, and the secrets we share. No one knows how
        beautiful our little world is. With you, it feels perfect.
